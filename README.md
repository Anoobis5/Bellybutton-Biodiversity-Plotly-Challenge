## Project Overview

For this project, we were tasked with completing an interactive dashboard that allows the user to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) dataset, which catalogues the microbes that colonize the human nazel cavity.

## Project Analysis

Our client has a partially completed dashboard with a completed panel for demographic information. Our clients wants to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer through a dropdown menu that will enable the volunteers to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. This will aid Improbable Beef in identifying a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, and the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel cavity.

The first asset we added to the webpage was a Bar Chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individualâ€™s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.
