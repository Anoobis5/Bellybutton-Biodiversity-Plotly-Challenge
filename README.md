## Project Overview

For this project, we were tasked with completing an interactive dashboard that allows the user to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) dataset, which catalogues the microbes that colonize the human navel cavity.

## Project Analysis

Our client has a partially completed dashboard with a completed panel for demographic information. Our clients wants to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer through a dropdown menu that will enable the volunteers to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. This will aid Improbable Beef in identifying a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, and the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel cavity. 


The first asset we added to the webpage was a Bar Chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individualâ€™s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. Please see below for a screenshot of the barchart on the webpage:

The next asset added to the dashboard, was a Bubble Chart that will also update to a volunteers selected ID from the dropdown menu. The Bubble chart:
  
    * Uses otu_ids for the x values.

    * Uses sample_values for the y values.

    * Uses sample_values for the marker size.

    * Usse otu_ids for the marker colors.

    * Uses otu_labels for the text values.
    
 
Please see below for a screenshot of the Bubblechart as displayed when you open the weblink:

The final asset added the the dashboard was a Guage chart. The Gauge chart displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on a progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu. Please see below for a screenshot of how the Gauge Chart is displayed when you open the webpage:

The final step in producing our finished interactive webpage, was to add a few customizations to make it standout. We added a microbe image background for our jumbotron banner, along with adding a gradient green colored background scheme to match the banner. We also edited the font/text to make it contrast with the background to make it more appealing and legibile with our go-green theme. We also customized the charts to have a black background and white text to match the theme as well. Our page is also reflesive for mobile viewing. Please see below for a screenshot of the completed webpage:
